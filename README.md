Reproducible Science Template
=============================

> More than 70% of researchers have tried and failed to reproduce another scientist's experiments, and more than half have failed to reproduce their own experiments. [[1]]

In an attempt to overcome this _reproducibility crisis_ in the field of modeling and simulation, everyone should aim for a fully automated workflow [[2]] from the input scripts to a finished document.
To not only provide _theoretical_ reproducibility, but a _practical_ one, everyone -- given the required computational power -- should be able to easily recreate those documents.

We would like to establish a working group within BAM that develops a wiki/handbook of possible approaches to tackle these challenges. 
Everyone should be able to access these documents and will be able to use these as a basis for future projects.
The competence center modeling and simulation will coordinate the efforts towards 
this goal, provide guidance and the infrastructure (e.g. a wiki, repositories). 
For completing the tasks itself, however, we mainly rely on the work of the interested participants.
