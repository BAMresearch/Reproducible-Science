Reproducible Science Template
=============================

Structure of the repository
---------------------------

(currently, do be discussed)

`computation/`

- scripts needed to run the simulations, e.g. via (`docker`)[docker.md]
- raw result files

`plots/`

- scripts needed for postprocessing that usually take data from `computation/` 
- publication-ready images (pdfs/pngs/...)

`tex/`

- tex code that usually takes the images from `plots/`

`/`

- the main `dodo.py` file that wires/automates all actions required to display 
  the publication-ready document
